# Hi, my name is Lidia :woman_technologist:	
I have recently graduated from IES San Clemente in Santiago de Compostela, Spain as a Higher Technician in Multi-platform Application Development.

I currently work as and Administrator but in my free time, I create computer aplications.

All my projects, up to now, are written in Galician as I would like to create something that gives visibility and extended use to our language. In this way I hope to do my bit.

During my curricular internship I thouroughly enjoyed working as part of a creative team of developers and I would like to go further as a programmer with a keen interest in AI.
